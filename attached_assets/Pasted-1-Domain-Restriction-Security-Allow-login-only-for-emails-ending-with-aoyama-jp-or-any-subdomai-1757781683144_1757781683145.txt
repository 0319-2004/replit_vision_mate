1. Domain Restriction & Security

Allow login only for emails ending with @aoyama.jp or any subdomain of aoyama.ac.jp.

Enforce on both client (UI error message) and server (middleware + RLS in Supabase).

Add a simple report button (e.g., under each progress post) that creates a record in a new reports table.

Add rate limiting for posting progress/comments to prevent spam (per user_id + IP).

2. Profiles

Expand user profile to include: name, bio, skills[], external links (GitHub, Portfolio), and avatar (upload to Supabase Storage).

Create a profile edit page.

Ensure avatars are stored securely (RLS: only owner can write, signed URL for public access).

3. Streaks & 👏 Reactions

Show user’s posting streak (continuous days of progress posts).

Add 👏 reaction to progress posts (one per user, can undo).

Show count next to each post.

4. Discovery & Ranking

Add a Discover page tab with:

Recommended projects (based on tags the user watched/joined).

Weekly ranking (most watched/joined/posted projects in last 7 days).

Tag search + sorting (latest / most active).

5. Invite Links

Add a “Share Project” section in project detail:

Copy link, Share to LINE, LinkedIn, Instagram.

For now just share the plain URL, but prepare code to support ?ref=USER_ID later.

6. Onboarding

When a new user logs in for the first time:

Prompt to set up their profile.

Show 3 sample projects and encourage 👀 watch or 👏 react.

7. Weekly Digest (Basic)

Add a weekly job (or cron-like API route) that logs “Top 5 active projects” and “Followed project updates.”

For now just print to console — email/LINE integration can be added later.

8. Moderation

Add admin-only page that lists all reports for review.

Allow admin to mark them as resolved or delete offending posts.

Add a rule to block new users from posting links for the first 24h.

9. Follow & Personalized Feed

Allow users to follow other users.

Add a timeline page showing progress posts only from followed users.

10. i18n (Japanese + English)

Add next-i18next or similar to support both Japanese and English.

Default language = Japanese, but allow toggle in navbar.

Deliverables:

Updated Next.js pages/components for these features

New Supabase tables & RLS policies (reports, follows, progress_likes, etc.)

Secure middleware.ts for domain checks

Minimal styling consistent with current UI

Ensure everything still works on local dev (npm run dev)

Important:

Do not break existing features.

Focus on minimal working implementation (MVP).

Comment the code where new functionality is added.
