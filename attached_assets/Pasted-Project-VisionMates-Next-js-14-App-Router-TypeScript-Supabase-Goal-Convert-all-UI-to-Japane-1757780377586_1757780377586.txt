Project: VisionMates (Next.js 14 + App Router, TypeScript, Supabase)
Goal:

Convert all UI to Japanese by default with JA/EN toggle (i18n).

Implement features below (MVP-ready).

Enforce Aoyama Gakuin domain restriction + safety (RLS, rate limits, reports).

Repo: <paste your GitHub URL>
Env: .env.local already has Supabase URL/ANON. Keep existing keys.

Scope

i18n (JA default, EN optional)

Use next-intl (or react-i18next) with App Router.

Extract all hardcoded strings to /messages/ja.json and /messages/en.json.

Add a LanguageToggle in the navbar. Persist selection in localStorage('vm_lang').

Acceptance: All primary pages (Home/Project/Profile/Login/Forms/Report UI) show JA by default and switch to EN instantly.

Domain allow-list (Aoyama Gakuin) + safety

Allowed: *.aoyama.ac.jp and aoyama.jp.

On sign-in, if email domain not allowed → signOut and show a clear error toast.

Guard protected routes via middleware.ts.

Add RLS policies so reads/writes require auth.email() to match the allow-list and auth.uid() = user_id for self-updates.

Rate-limit comments/progress inserts: max 1 per 30s per user (server-side check).

Env example:

ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN_PATTERNS=/(^|\\.)aoyama\\.ac\\.jp$/i,/(^|\\.)aoyama\\.jp$/i


Acceptance: Non-allowed emails are blocked at auth and DB level. Rapid repeats are rejected.

Profile

Edit page /profile and public page /u/[id].

Fields: display_name, bio, skills (string array), links (github, portfolio), avatar (Supabase Storage avatars).

Acceptance: Edit → Save → Public page updates immediately (i18n labels/validation included).

Streak & 👏 Reactions

progress_updates table already used; add RPC get_user_streak(user_id) to compute daily streak.

Add claps(update_id, user_id) with unique constraint (1 clap per user).

Show clap count & my-clap state on timeline; show streak on profile (numeric is fine).

Acceptance: Works for two test users.

Discovery (explore)

/explore or /discover:

Recommended projects (match user skills ↔ project tags).

Weekly ranking (sum of 👀 watch + ✋ raise + 🚀 commit + 👏 within current week).

Tag search with cloud and sorting (recent activity / most intent / newest).

Acceptance: Search & sort work, SSR/CSR OK.

Share link (basic)

On project page, “Copy link” button.

Utility buildProjectShareUrl(projectId, refUserId?) to optionally append ?ref=<user_id>.

Acceptance: Clipboard copy with toast.

DM / Group chat (MVP)

Tables: conversations, conversation_members, messages, message_mentions.

1:1 and small groups (≤20).

Read receipts (store last_read_message_id per member), @mentions (@display_name parsing), image preview (Storage).

Realtime subscribe to messages.

UI at /messages: left list + right thread.

Acceptance: Two users can DM, see read status, send an image, mention highlights the recipient.

Moderation

reports(resource_type, resource_id, reporter_id, reason) + admin page listing reported items.

New users restricted for 24h (links/images blocked). Server-side guard too.

Acceptance: Report appears in admin list; restriction prevents posting.

Weekly digest (email)

Supabase Scheduled Function (weekly):

New progress in followed/watched projects

Top 3 projects of the week

User setting to enable/disable.

Acceptance: Manual trigger sends a test email.

Inline translation (JP⇄EN)

Add lib/translate.ts with translate(text, targetLang) interface.

For now stub/mock, later switch to DeepL/OpenAI via env keys.

“Translate” button on comments/progress to toggle original/translated text.

Acceptance: Button shows a translated stub now; swapping provider via env works later.

DB (Supabase) additions (if missing)

profiles(id uuid pk references auth.users, display_name text, bio text, skills text[] default '{}', github_url text, portfolio_url text, avatar_url text, created_at timestamptz default now())

claps(id uuid pk, update_id uuid, user_id uuid, created_at, unique(update_id, user_id))

conversations, conversation_members(last_read_message_id), messages(text,image_url), message_mentions

reports(...)

RLS policies per above; rate-limit checks on insert.

Deliverables

Branch: feature/i18n-and-core-addons

Readme updates (env, setup, test instructions)

i18n key map (messages/ja.json, messages/en.json)

Test checklist

i18n default JA + toggle to EN, all major pages covered.

Non-Aoyama email blocked (auth + RLS).

30s spam blocked.

Profile edit/public view OK.

Streak & claps working.

Explore: recommend/ranking/tag search OK.

Share link copies.

DM: send/receive, read receipts, image preview, mentions.

Reports/admin & 24h restriction enforced.

Weekly digest manual run sends email.

Inline translation button toggles text.

If something is unclear, split into PRs in this order: i18n → safety (domain/RLS/rate) → profile → streak/claps → discovery → share → DM → moderation → digest → translation.
